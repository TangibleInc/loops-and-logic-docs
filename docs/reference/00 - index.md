# Reference Guides

Here is a description of how the codebase is organized for Loops & Logic and Tangible Blocks.

It will include a guide for developing the plugins and their modules.

These reference pages are programmatically generated from Markdown files in the source code, as well as extracted from comment blocks, class and function definitions.

Currently, the Template System is going through an overhaul and re-organization with the aim of documenting and testing each module. Many of the pages will be minimal until they're written.
