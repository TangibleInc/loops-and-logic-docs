The term _query_ isn’t unique to Loops & Logic, but it’s often used to express what happens when you run L&L markup. A query is a process of requesting or manipulating data in a database, in our case the WordPress database that contains all the data associated with the site. When you write L&L markup that performs an action such as searching, filtering, or sorting through a particular type of content, that code is querying the database whenever it’s loaded on a page. The most common query in L&L is the `<Loop>` query.
