If you’re averse to learning new terms, you can think of the term _parameter_ as a synonym of _attribute_. When you’re writing markup, the general syntax used for a parameter will look just like the syntax used for an attribute.

That being said, in the L&L documentation and in advanced WordPress development in general, you’ll find that when we refer to the attributes of a query (such as the attributes of the `<Loop>` tag), we call those _query parameters_ because that’s a common term used to refer to the internal working of WordPress’s loop query. In contrast, other dynamic tags that don’t create queries (such as the `<Field />` tag) simply use the term _attribute_ just like normal HTML syntax.
