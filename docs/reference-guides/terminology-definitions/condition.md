Sometimes referred to as conditional logic (from which Loop & Logic inherits half of its name), _conditions_ in L&L allow you to show or skip content based on a set of rules. This is done with the `<If>` or `<Switch>` tag, usually by checking how a specific field of a post compares to an expected value.
