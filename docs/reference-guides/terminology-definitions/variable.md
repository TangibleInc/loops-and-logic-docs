Just like in algebra class, a variable is a placeholder that can hold a value. In L&L, variables can hold all kinds of data, from simple numbers or strings (like a user’s name) to things as complex as an entire query. Variables are created using the `<Set>` tag and are retrieved or referenced using the `<Get />` tag.
