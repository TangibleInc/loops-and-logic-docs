Anyone familiar with HTML will know that a _tag_ is a piece of markup language that indicates the beginning and end of an HTML element. Tags are distinct from normal text and are formed with angle brackets around the tag name, like `<this>`. Since L&L is an extension of HTML, it adds its own tags to the standard ones available in HTML. To differentiate the tags in HTML from those added by Loops & Logic, we use the term _static tag_ to refer to standard HTML tags like `<div>` and `<img>` and _dynamic tag_ to refer to those added by L&L, like `<Loop>` and `<Field>`. L&L's dynamic tags are always capitalized to easily tell them apart from HTML's static tags.

If you’re an Elementor Pro user, you may be familiar with Elementor’s concept of Dynamic Tags, which allows certain dynamic content to be added to certain content fields. It’s important to realize that Elementor’s use of that term is unrelated to dynamic tags in L&L. We use the term _tag_ to illustrate the similarity with HTML tags and we use the term _dynamic_ to show that those tags actively interact with your site’s data dynamically. As a bonus, unlike Elementor, our dynamic tags like `<Field>` allow you to display content from a much wider variety of sources!
