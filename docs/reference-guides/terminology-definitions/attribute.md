_Attributes_ in L&L work the same way they work in HTML; they modify something about the tag they’re placed in. An attribute is usually a pair of “key” and “value”. For example, in the dynamic tag `<Field name="title" />`, the key is `name` and the value is `title` which together form an attribute of the `Field` tag. The way to specify the value of an attribute can be a bit unique, which we’ll explain in the syntax section below.
