The `Glider` tag provides a full-screen gallery slider. Note that this tag is a module, which means that it loads an additional library when used.

It expects thumbnail images linked to their full-size URLs.

```html
<Glider>
  <a href="img/img1.jpg">
    <img src="img/thumb1.jpg" />
  </a>
  <a href="img/img2.jpg">
    <img src="img/thumb2.jpg" />
  </a>
</Glider>
```
