However, since setting data does not always exist in a 1-1 relationship to database entries, the interaction between Loops&Logic, Woocommerce and the provided template accessors is subject to slight customisation.

In general, most options such as woocommerce_review_rating_verification_label are available in whatever raw form they are stored in the database.

In other cases such as woocommerce_default_country, even though the raw value can be accessed using

`<Get setting=woocommerce_default_country />`

the "raw" value is not particularly useful; in this case, it contains both the country and the state, so Loops for Woocommerce provides these two specific methods to access the country and state separately:

`<Setting woocommerce=country />`

`<Setting woocommerce=state />`

An alternate way of getting Woocommerce settings is by using the shortcut form `<Setting woo=setting_name/>`.
